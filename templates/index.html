    <h2>Intro and Background</h2>
    <p>
        The Democratic Republic of Congo is located in the south west area of Africa. It is mostly composed of rainforests, plains, and valleys. It has a population of nearly 80 million people and is considered one of the most resource rich countries in the world. However these resources have enticed more powerful countries to influence and control the DRC. This is compounded with ethnic based conflicts and wars that the Congo has faced to make it one of the most dangerous countries in the world.

    <h2>Colonization</h2>
    <p>The colonization of the Congo started in 1885 with the Belgian King Leopold II who, by getting many of the tribe leaders to sign legal documents obliviously, would obtain a large amount of the Congoâ€™s land for private colonization. His justification to European powers was the development of the country and the increase of free trade. However in reality he was exploiting the country for its resources and its people faced cruel treatment underneath his rule. The Belgian rule over the Congo would end when the country gained its independence in 1960.
